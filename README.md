# Background of SmartGate
spatial metabolomics by introducing an iterative graph attention auto-encoder method SmartGate
For imaging mass spectrum (IMS) datasets, SmartGate could get latent low dimension peak features by Graph-attention autoencoder which help us achieve automatic peak picking iteratively to find the marker ions.
